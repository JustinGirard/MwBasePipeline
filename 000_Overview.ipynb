    "To set up the solution for local development of everything, you will need pull a few git libraries. Put these all in the same directory. You will not need any path variables (as it may be true that a person has multiple branches in development at one time). Please use python 3.6+ and run on linux.\n",
    "1. [findclass](https://github.com/JustinGirard/findclass) This is a simple dynamic class / module locator that Justin uses widely. Maybe one day it will be open sourced for the world.\n",
    "2. [processingNetwork](https://github.com/JustinGirard/processingNetwork) This is a very important graph based dependency resolver that works natively in json to resolve large in memory dependency graphs. Justin uses this as a base class on most projects, and will slowly introduce some really fancy techniques using this module over time (but not in Phase 0, or 1).\n",
    "3. [DataPipeline](http://example.com) This is the **MistyWest** abstract base project for making data pipelines. A lot of pacing, diagraming, and coffee was used in the construction of this base system.\n",
    "4. [MwBasePipeline/pipeline.py](pipeline.py) This is the **MistyWest** Example pipeline. This pipeline (today) grabs some example data via a **Task**, stores it using a **DataLake**, and serves this data using a **Request** where all the dependencies and dev ops related concerns are managed via a **System**. \n",
    "5. [MwBasePipeline/03_PluginExample.ipynb](03_PluginExample.ipynb) This is the **MistyWest** Example plugin. This plugin is extremely simple, and just grabs some financial data for display. The fact that it is only a few lines of code is really great (it means the other layers are doing their jobs well, so far.)\n",
